I started writing a NES emulator in C over Christmas for my own enjoyment. The 6502 CPU works and work has started on the PPU. 

## Building on Windows

Run `win_build.bat`

To build and run functional tests, download 6502_functional_test.bin from https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests and then run `win_functional_test.bat`.

Note that decimal mode isn't implemented because the NES apparently does not support it.

## Building on Mac

To build and run functional tests, download 6502_functional_test.bin from https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests and then run `mac_functional_test.sh`.
